=head1 NAME

rewrite-swish-src.pl -- tries to rewrite swish-e source to be portable

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This script converts a swish-e source code tree to be 64bit friendly,
mostly by replacing various int types with known 64bit (or possibly larger) 
versions, and by replacing printf-style format strings to match. See the source
code for details about its operation; essentially we script a series
of inserts, general and file-specific replacements, and exceptions.

Additionally, any line containing a comment like 
    // no rw64 
or 
    /* no rw64 */
will remain unchanged.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

It can be used like so:

   % svn co http://svn.swish-e.org/swish-e/trunk swish-e-portable
       (this fetches trunk into swish-e-portable/ )
   % cd swish-e-portable
   % ./configure
      (use ./configure CFLAGS="-O0 -g" for non optimized, debug build)
   % ./rewrite-swish-src.pl
   % make

It's intended that (while using this script for development)
we'll make the 64bit changes to rewrite-swish-src.pl, not to the SVN
tree directly. So after you've made some changes to rewrite-swish-src.pl, you can retest your
changes with:

   % ./rewrite-swish-src.pl -refresh
       (removes src/*.c and src/*.h, refetches them from svn, and rewrites them)
   % make 

Also, note that to turn compiler optimization off, and debug symbols on, 
as mentioned above, use configure this way:

   
   % ./configure CFLAGS="-O0 -g'
     (that's an O letter and a zero).  

NOTE: any line with a comment matching the regex m{# no rw64} or m{/\* no rw64 .*}
is passed through unaltered. So you can add that comment to lines to have their ints
preserved.

rewrites swish-e source to be portable between 32bit and 64bit architectures.

=head1 OPTIONS

Overall view of the options.

=over 4

=item --verbose/--noverbose

Turns on/off verbose mode. (off by default)

=item --debug/--nodebug

Turns on/off debug mode, which builds an exe and runs in under gdb. 
(off by default)

=item --grind/--nogrind 

Turns on/off grind mode, which builds an exe and runs it under valgrind.
(off by default)

=item --refresh/--norefresh

Turns on/off 'refresh' mode, which _deletes_ all files 
matching src/*.c and src/*.h, and refetches them from SVN before 
performing 64bit alterations. (off by default)

=back

=head1 DISCUSSION

The tricky part of this port seems to be functions and variables 
that must retain machine-native 'int' types because they are used 
as callbacks (for example with libxml2), or for deep system calls 
(like waitpid). 

Close attention to 'type mismatch' warnings is clearly important.
Perhaps some combo of gcc options would help --
-Wall seems to report too little, and -pedantic reports too much.

=head1 TO DO

While this port will make indexes portable between current (linux) 32bit and 64bit 
architectures, it's possible that some systems will implement a 
'long long' type larger than 64bits and thus not produce binary 
compatible indexes with 64bit int systems. It's intended that this
be handled in a later port.
