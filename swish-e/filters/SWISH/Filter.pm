=head1 NAME

SWISH::Filter - Perl extension for filtering documents with Swish-e

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use SWISH::Filter;

  # load available filters into memory
  my $filter = SWISH::Filter->new;


  # convert a document

  my $doc = $filter->convert(
        document     => \$scalar_ref,  # path or ref to a doc
        content_type => $content_type, # content type if doc reference
        name         => $real_path,    # optional name for this file (useful for debugging)
        user_data    => $whatever,     # optional data to make available to filters
   );

  return unless $doc;  # empty doc, zero size, or no filters installed

  # Was the document converted by a filter?
  my $was_filtered = $doc->was_filtered;

  # Skip if the file is not text
  return if $doc->is_binary;

  # Print out the doc
  my $doc_ref = $doc->fetch_doc;
  print $$doc_ref;

  # Fetch the final content type of the document
  my $content_type = $doc->content_type;

  # Fetch swish-e parser type (TXT*, XML*, HTML*, or undefined)
  my $doc_type = $doc->swish_parser_type;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SWISH::Filter provides a unified way to convert documents into a type that swish-e
can index.  Individual filters are installed as separate perl modules.  For example,
there might be a filter that converts from PDF format to HTML format.

Note that this is just a framework for filtering documents.  Additional helper programs
or Perl module may need to be installed to use SWISH::Filter to filter documents.  For
example, to filter PDF documents you must install the Xpdf package.

The filters are automatically loaded when C<SWISH::Filters-E<gt>new()> is called.  Filters
define a type and priority that determines the processing order of the filter.  Filters are
processed in this sort order until a filter accepts the document for filtering. The filter
uses the document's content type to determine if the filter should handle the current
document.

The individual filters are not designed to be used as separate modules.  All access to
the filters is through this SWISH::Filter module.

Normally, once a document is filtered processing stops.  Some filters can filter the document
yet set a flag saying that filtering should continue (for example a filter that uncompresses a
MS Word document before passing on to the filter that converts from MS Word to text).
All this should be transparent to the end user.

The idea of SWISH::Filter is that new filters can be created, and then downloaded and
installed to provide new filtering capabilities.  For example, if you needed to index MS
Excel documents you might be able to download a filter from the Swish-e site and magically
next time you run indexing MS Excel docs would be indexed.

The SWISH::Filter setup can be used with -S prog or -S http.  It works best with the
-S prog method because the filter modules only need to be loaded and compiled one time.
The -S prog program F<spider.pl> will automatically use SWISH::Filter when spidering with
default settings (using "default" as the first parameter to spider.pl).

The -S http indexing method uses a Perl helper script called F<swishspider>.  F<swishspider>
has been updated to work with SWISH::Filter, but (unlike spider.pl) does not contain a "use
lib" line to point to the location of SWISH::Filter.  This means that by default
F<swishspider> will B<not> use SWISH::Filter for filtering.  The reason for this is because
F<swishspider> runs for every URL fetched, and loading the Filters for each document can be
slow.  The recommended way of spidering is using -S prog with spider.pl, but if -S http is
desired the way to enable SWISH::Filter is to set PERL5LIB before running swish so that
F<swishspider> will be able to locate the SWISH::Filter module.  Here's one way
to set the PERL5LIB with the bash shell:

  $ export PERL5LIB=`swish-filter-test -path`



=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item $filter = SWISH::Filter->new()

This creates a SWISH::Filter object.  You may pass in options as a list or a hash reference.

=back

=head2 SWISH::Filter->new Options

There is currently only one option that can be passed in to new():

=over 4

=item ignore_filters

Pass in a reference to a list of filter names to ignore.  For example, if you have two filters installed
"Pdf2HTML" and "Pdf2XML" and want to avoid using "Pdf2XML":

    my $filter = SWISH::Filter->new( ignore_filters => ['Pdf2XML'];


=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    $class = ref( $class ) || $class;

    my %attr = ref $_[0] ? %{$_[0]} : @_ if @_;

B<Depreciated>: Use the convert() method instead.


See $swish->convert for options.

Returns true if the document was converted.

    return $doc_object->was_filtered;
}



=item $doc_object = $filter->convert();

This method filters a document.  Returns an object of the class SWISH::Filter::Document
or undefined if passed in an empty document, a filename that cannot be read off disk, or 
if no filters have been loaded.

Methods in L<SWISH::Filter::Document Methods> below can be called on the object to, for
example, check if the document was filtered and to fetch the document content (filtered or
not).

You must pass in a hash (or hash reference) of parameters to the convert() method.  The
possible parameters are:

=over 8

=item document

This can be either a path to a file, or a scalar reference to a document in memory.
This is required.

=item content_type

The MIME type of the document.  This is only required when passing in a scalar reference
to a document is passed. The content type string is what the filters use to match
a document type.

When passing in a file name and C<content_type> is not set, then the content type will
be determined from the file's extension by using the MIME::Types Perl module (available on CPAN).

=item name

Optional name to pass in to filters that will be used in error and warning messages.

=item user_data

Optional data structure that all filters may access.
This can be fetched in a filter by:

    my $user_data = $doc_object->user_data;

And used in the filter as:

    if ( ref $user_data && $user_data->{pdf2html}{title} ) {
       ...
    }

It's up to the filter author to use a unique first-level hash key for a given filter.

=head1 SWISH::Filter::Document Methods

These methods are available to Filter authors, and also provide access to the
document after calling the convert() method to end-users of SWISH::Filter.

End users of SWISH::Filter will use a subset of these methods.  Mostly:

   $doc_object->fetch_doc      # and alias for fetch_document_reference()
   $doc_object->was_filtered   # true the document was filtered
   $doc_object->content_type   # document's current content type (mime type)
   $doc_object->swish_parser_type # returns a parser type to use with swish-e -S prog method
   $doc_object->is_binary      # returns $content_type !~ m[^text/];

These methods are also available to the individual filter modules.  The filter's "filter"
function is also passed a SWISH::Filter::Document object.  Method calls may be made on this
object to check the document's current content type, or to fetch the document as either a
file name or a reference to a scalar containing the document content.

=item $doc_ref = $doc_object->fetch_doc_reference;

Returns a scalar reference to the document.  This can be used when the filter
can operate on the document in memory (or if an external program expects the input
to be from standard input).

If the file is currently on disk then it will be read into memory.  If the file was stored
in a temporary file on disk the file will be deleted once read into memory.
The file will be read in binmode if $doc->is_binary is true.

Note that $doc_object->fetch_doc is an alias.

=cut

sub fetch_doc_reference {
    my ( $self ) = @_;

    return ref $self->{cur_doc}  # just $self->read_file should work
        ? $self->{cur_doc}
        : $self->read_file;
}

# here's an alias for fetching a document reference.

*fetch_doc = *fetch_doc_reference;


=item $was_filtered = $doc_object->was_filtered

Returns true if some filter processed the document

=cut

sub was_filtered {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->filters_used ? 1 : 0;
}

=item $content_type = $doc_object->content_type;

Fetches the current content type for the document.

Example:

    return unless $filter->content_type =~ m!application/pdf!;


=cut

sub content_type {
    return $_[0]->{content_type} || '';
}

=item $doc_object->is_binary

Returns true if the document's content-type does not match "text/".

=back

=cut

sub is_binary {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->content_type !~ m[^text];
}

=head2 Methods used by filter authors

=over 4
    
=item $file_name = $doc_object->fetch_filename;

Returns a path to the document as stored on disk.
This name can be passed to external programs (e.g. catdoc) that expect input
as a file name.

If the document is currently in memory then a temporary file will be created.  Do not expect
the file name passed to be the real path of the document.

The file will be written in binmode if $doc->is_binary is true.

This method is not normally used by end-users of SWISH::Filter.

=cut


# This will create a tempoary file if file is in memory

sub fetch_filename {
    my ( $self ) = @_;

    return ref $self->{cur_doc}

        : $self->{cur_doc};
}

=item $doc_object->set_continue;

Processing will continue to the next filter if this is set to a true value.
This should be set for filters that change encodings or uncompress documents.

=cut

sub set_continue {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    return $self->continue(1);

Sets the content type for a document.

=cut

sub set_content_type {
    my ( $self, $type ) = @_;
    die "Failed to pass in new content type\n" unless $type;

    $self->{cur_doc} = $file_name;
    $self->{temp_file} = $file_name;

    return $file_name;
}


=item $doc_object->name

Fetches the name of the current file.  This is useful for printing out the
name of the file in an error message.
This is the name passed in to the SWISH::Filter->convert method.
It is optional and thus may not always be set.  

    my $name = $doc_object->name || 'Unknown name';
    warn "File '$name': failed to convert -- file may be corrupt\n";


=item $doc_object->user_data

Fetches the the user_data passed in to the filter.
This can be any data or data structure passed into SWISH::Filter->new.

This is an easy way to pass special parameters into your filters.

Example:

    my $data = $doc_object->user_data;
    # see if a choice for the <title> was passed in
    if ( ref $data eq 'HASH' && $data->{pdf2html}{title_field}  {

# These methods really belong in SWISH::Filter, but geneally don't make sense without
# a SWISH::Filter::Document object.

=item $doc_ref = $filter->run_program( $program, @args );

Runs $program with @args.  Must pass in @args.

Under Windows calls IPC::Open2, which may pass data through the shell.  Double-quotes are
escaped (backslashed) and each parameter is wrapped in double-quotes.

On other platforms a fork and exec is used to avoid passing any data through the shell.
Returns a reference to a scalar containing the output from your program, or dies.

This method is intended to read output from a program that converts one format into text.
The output is read back in text mode -- on systems like Windows this means \r\n (CRLF) will
be convertet to \n.

=head1 WRITING FILTERS

Filters are standard perl modules that are installed into the SWISH::Filters name space.
Filters are not complicated -- see the existing filters for examples.

Filters are linked together in a chain, and have a type and priority that set the order of the
filter in the chain.  Filters check the content type of the document to see if they should process
the document.  If the filter processes the document it returns either a file name or a reference to a scalar.
Normally a reference to a scalar of the converted document should be returned.
If the filter does not process the document then it returns undef and the next filter in the chain has a chance
to process the document.

If a filter calls die then the filter is removed from the chain and will not be
called again I<during the same run>.  Calling die when running with -S http or -S fs has no effect since the
program is run once per document.

Once a filter returns something other than undef no more filters will be called.  If the filter calls $filter->set_continue
then processing will continue as if the file was not filtered.  For example, a filter can uncompress data and then
set $filter->set_continue and let other filters process the document.


This is the list of methods the filter should or may define (as specificed):

=over 4

=item new()  * required *

This method returns either an object which provides access to the filter, or undefined
if the filter is not to be used.

The new() method is a good place to check for required modules or helper programs.
Returning undefined prevents the filter from being included in the filter chain.

=item filter() * required *

This is the function that does the work of converting a document from one content type
to another.

=item type()

Returns a number from 1 to 10.  Filters are sorted (for processing in a specific order)
and this number is simply the primary key used in sorting.  If not specified
the filter's type used for sorting is 2.


=item priority()

Returns a number from 1 to 10.  Filters are sorted (for processing in a specific order)
and this number is simply the primary key used in sorting.  If not specified
the filter's priority is 50.

=back

Again, the point of the type() and priority() methods is to allow setting the sort order
of the filters.  Useful if you have two filters that for filtering similar content-types,
but prefer to use one over the other.

Here's a module to index MS Word documents using the program "catdoc":

    package SWISH::Filters::Doc2txt;
    use vars qw/ @ISA $VERSION /;

    $VERSION = '0.01';
    @ISA = ('SWISH::Filter');

    sub new {
        my ( $pack, %params ) = @_;

        my $self = bless {
            name => $params{name} || $pack,
        }, $pack;


        # check for helpers
        for my $prog ( qw/ catdoc / ) {
            my $path = $self->find_binary( $prog );
            unless ( $path ) {
                $self->mywarn("Can not use Filter $pack -- need to install $prog");
                return;
            }
            $self->{$prog} = $path;
        }

        return $self;

    }



    sub filter {
    my ( $self, $document ) = @_;

        # Do we care about this document?
        return unless $document->content_type =~ m!application/msword!;

        # We need a file name to pass to the catdoc program
        my $file = $document->fetch_filename;


        # Grab output from running program
        my $content = $document->run_program( $self->{catdoc}, $file );

        return unless $content;

        # update the document's content type
        $document->set_content_type( 'text/plain' );

        # return the document
        return \$content;
    }
    1;




=head1 TESTING

Filters can be tested with the F<swish-filter-test> program.  Run:

   swish-filter-test -man

for documentation.

=head1 SUPPORT

Please contact the Swish-e discussion list.  http://swish-e.org

=head1 Bugs, todo items, and other notes

I wonder if the filters shouldn't just register the content types they handle
instead of checking the content type.  Would want to be able to register regular 
expressions.
