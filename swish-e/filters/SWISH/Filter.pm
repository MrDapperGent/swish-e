=head1 NAME

SWISH::Filter - Perl extension for filtering documents with Swish-e

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use SWISH::Filter;
  my $filter = SWISH::Filter->new;

  
  my $was_filtered = $filter->filter(
        document     => \$scalar_ref,  # path or ref to a doc
        content_type => $content_type, # content type if doc reference
        name         => $real_path,    # optional name for this file (useful for debugging)
        user_data    => $whatever,     # optional data to make available to filters
   );


  # Print out the doc
  if ( $was_filtered ) {
      my $doc_ref = $filter->fetch_doc;
      print $$doc_ref;
  }

  # Fetch the content type of the document
  my $content_type = $filter->content_type;

  # Fetch swish-e parser type (TXT*, XML*, HTML*)
  my $doc_type = $filter->swish_parser_type;

  

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SWISH::Filter provides a unified way to convert documents into a type that swish-e
can index.  Filters are installed as Perl modules under the path SWISH::Filters.
As expected, the @INC array is used to find the modules.

The filters are automatically loaded when C<SWISH::Filters::new()> is called.  Filters define
a type and priority that determines the processing order of the filter.  Filters are processed
in this sort order until a filter accepts the document for filtering.
Filters use the documents's content type to determine if the filter should handle the current document.

Normally, once a document is filtered processing stops.  Some filters can filter the document
yet set a flag saying that filtering should continue (for example a filter that uncompresses a
MS Word document before passing on to the filter that converts from MS Word to text).

=head1 METHODS

=item $swish_filter = SWISH::Filter->new()

This creates a SWISH::Filter object.  You may pass in options as a list or a hash reference.

=head2 Options

There is currently only one option that can be passed in to new():

=over 4

=item ignore_filters

Pass in a reference to a list of filter names to ignore.  For example, if you have two filters installed
"Pdf2HTML" and "Pdf2XML" and want to avoid using "Pdf2XML":

    my $swish_filter = SWISH::Filter->new( ignore_filters => ['Pdf2XML'];

sub new {

    my $self = bless {}, $class;

    $self->{skip_filters} = {};

    $self->ignore_filters( $attr{ignore_filters} ) if $attr{ignore_filters};

    $self->get_filter_list;

    $self->{mimetypes} = MIME::Types->new;

    return $self;
}

sub ignore_filters {
    my ( $self, $filters ) = @_;

    unless ( $filters ) {
        return unless $self->{ignore_filter_list};
        return @{$self->{ignore_filter_list}};
    }

    @{$self->{ignore_filter_list}} = @$filters;
    

    # create lookup hash for filters to skip
    $self->{skip_filters} = map { $_, 1 } @$filters;
}

=item $filtered = $swish_filter->filter();

This method filters a document.  Returns true if the document was filtered.
You must pass in a hash (or hash reference) of parameters.  The possible parameters are:

=over 8

=item document

This can be either a path to a file, or a scalar reference to a document in memory.

=item content_type

The MIME type of the document.  This is only required when passing in a scalar reference
to a document is passed. The content type string is what the filters used to match
a document type.

When passing in a file name and C<content_type> is not set, then the content type will
be determined from the file's extension by using the MIME::Types Perl module (available on CPAN).

=item name

Optional name to pass in to filters that will be used in error and warning messages.

=item user_data

Optional data structure that all filters may access.

This can be fetched in a filter by:

    my $user_data = $filter->user_data;

And an example use might be:    

    if ( ref $user_data && $user_data->{pdf2html}{title} ) {
       ...
    }


=back

Example:

    $filtered = $swish_filter->filter(
        document     => $doc_ref,
        content-type => 'application/pdf',
    );

This method returns true if the document was filtered, otherwise false.

Returns the content type of the document after filtering.

=cut

sub content_type {
    return $_[0]->{content_type};
}

=item $type = $swish_filter->swish_parser_type

Returns the swish parser type for the document, or undefined.

For example, in a -S prog program you can set the parser that swish-e will
use:

    if ( my $type = $swish_filter->swish_parser_type ) {

=head1 WRITING FILTERS

Filters are standard perl modules that are installed into the SWISH::Filters name space.
They are procedural yet do not export any functions.


Here's a module to index MS Word documents using the program "catdoc":

    package SWISH::Filters::Doc2txt;
    use vars qw/ %FilterInfo $VERSION /;

    $VERSION = '0.01';

    %FilterInfo = (
        type     => 2,  # normal filter
        priority => 50, # normal priority 1-100
    );

    sub filter {
        my $filter = shift;


        # Do we care about this document?
        return unless $filter->content_type =~ m!application/msword!;

        # We need a file name to pass to the catdoc program
        my $file = $filter->fetch_filename;
        

        # Grab output from running program
        my $content = $filter->run_program( 'catdoc', $file );

        return unless $content;

        # update the document's content type
        $filter->set_content_type( 'text/plain' );

        # return the document
        return \$content;
    }
    1;

Filters are linked together in a chain, and have a type and priority that set the order of the
filter in the chain.  Filters check the content type of the document to see if they should process
the document.  If the filter processes the document it returns either a file name or a reference to a scalar.
Normally a reference to a scalar of the converted document should be returned.
If the filter does not process the document then it returns undef and the next filter in the chain has a chance
to process the document.

If a filter calls die then the filter is removed from the chain and will not be
called again I<during the same run>.  Calling die when running with -S http or -S fs has no effect since the
program is run once per document.

Once a filter returns something other than undef no more filters will be called.  If the filter calls $filter->set_continue
then processing will continue as if the file was not filtered.  For example, a filter can uncompress data and then
set $filter->set_continue and let other filters process the document.

Your filter must contain a subroutine called "filter()" and a package hash called %FilterInfo.

The %FilterInfo hash determines the order of the filter in the chain.

The "type" setting should be:

=over 4

=item 1 filters that convert encoding or uncompress.

Type 1 filters are typically filters that always call $filter->set_continue.

=item 2 filters that convert a document to a format readable by Swish-e (text, HTML, or XML).

=back

The "priority" setting is a number in the range of 1 - 100 and allows ordering of the filters
within their type group.

=head2 Methods Available to Filters

The filter's "filter" function is passed an object.  Method calls may be made on this object to
check the document's current content type, or to fetch the document as either a file name or
a reference to a scalar containing the document content.

    my $self = shift;

    unlink delete $self->{temp_file} if $self->{temp_file};
}
    
=item $file_name = $filter->fetch_filename;

Returns a path to the document as stored on disk.
This name can be passed to external programs (e.g. catdoc) that expect input
as a file name.

If the document is currently in memory then a temporary file will be created.  Do not expect
the file name passed to be the real path of the document.

=cut


# This will create a tempoary file if file is in memory

sub fetch_filename {
    my ( $self ) = @_;

        ? $self->create_temp_file
        : $self->{cur_doc};
}

=item $doc_ref = $filter->fetch_doc_reference;

Returns a scalar reference to the document.  This can be used when the filter
can operate on the document in memory (or if an external program expects the input
to be from standard input).

If the file is currently on disk then it will be read into memory.  If the file was stored
in a temporary file on disk the file will be deleted once read into memory.

=cut

    my ( $self ) = @_;

    return ref $self->{cur_doc}
        ? $self->{cur_doc}
        : $self->read_file;
}

=item $filter->set_continue;

Processing will continue to the next filter if this is set to a true value.
This should be set for filters that change encodings or uncompress documents.

=cut

sub set_continue {
    my ( $self ) = @_;
    return $self->continue(1);

    my ( $self, $continue ) = @_;

=item $content_type = $filter->content_type;

Fetches the current content type for the document.

Example:

    return unless $filter->content_type =~ m!application/pdf!;


=cut

sub content_type {
    return $_[0]->{content_type} || '';
}


=item $filter->set_content_type( $type );

Sets the content type for a document.

=cut

    $self->{content_type} = $type;

    return $doc if ref $doc;

    my $sym = gensym;
    open($sym, "<$doc" ) or die "Failed to open file '$doc': $!";
    local $\ = undef;

    $self->{cur_doc} = $file_name;
    $self->{temp_file} = $file_name;

    return $file_name;
}


=item $filter->name

Fetches the name of the current file.  This is useful for printing out the
name of the file in an error message.
This is the name passed in to the SWISH::Filter->new method.
It is optional and thus may not always be set.  

    my $name = $filter->name || 'Unknown name';
    warn "File '$name': failed to convert -- file may be corrupt\n";

    
=item $filter->user_data

Fetches the the user_data passed in to the filter.
This can be any data or data structure passed into SWISH::Filter->new.

This is an easy way to pass special parameters into your filters.

Example:

    my $data = $filter->user_data;
    # see if a choice for the <title> was passed in
    if ( ref $data eq 'HASH' && $data->{pdf2html}{title_field}  {
       ...

       return $self->{$attr_name};
    }  

    die "No such method: $AUTOLOAD\n";
}


=item $doc_ref = $filter->run_program( $program, @args );

Runs $program with @args.  Must pass in @args.

Under Windows calls
IPC::Open2, which passes data through the shell.  Double-quotes are escaped (backslashed)
and each parameter is wrapped in double-quotes.

On other platforms a fork and exec is used to avoid passing any data through the shell.

Returns a reference to a scalar containing the output from your program, or dies.
