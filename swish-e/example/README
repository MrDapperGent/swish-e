These are example scripts that can be used with SWISH-E.

swish.cgi   - example search script that allows displaying results
              page-by-page.  Type `perldoc swish.cgi' from the
              examples directory for instructions.
              The CGI script does require Perl modules available
              on CPAN.
              
swish.tmpl  - HTML template files for use with swish.cgi.
