    The SWISH-E README File

What is SWISHE?
    SWISH-Enhanced is a fast, powerful, flexible, free, and easy to use
    system for indexing collections of documents. The documents may be on a
    local file system, or remotely accessed via http.

  Key features include

    *   Quickly index a large number of documents in different formats
        including text, html, and XML

    *   Use "filters" to index any type of file such as PDF, gzip

    *   Document "properties" (some subset of the source document, usually
        defined as a META or XML elements) may be stored in the index and
        returned with search results

    *   Document summaries can be returned with each search

    *   Word stemming and soundex indexing

    *   Phrase searching and wildcard searching

    *   Results can be sorted by relevance or by any number of properties in
        ascending or decending order

    *   Limit searches to parts of documents such as certain HTML tags
        (META, TITLE, comments, etc.) or to XML elements.

    *   It's open source and FREE! You can customize SWISH-E and you can
        contribute your fancy new features to the project.

How do I read the SWISH-E documentation?
    The SWISH-E documentation is in POD format. POD documentation is
    displayed by the `perldoc' command that is included with every Perl
    installation. For example, to view the installation documentation for
    swish-e, type

       perldoc INSTALL

    Check with your system adminstrator if this command is not available.

    Online documentation can be found at the SWISH-E web site listed above.
    Optionally, if you have the pod2html utility on your system you can
    convert the documenation into HTML format for viewing with a web
    browser. Instructions for converting the documentation can be found in
    INSTALL.
