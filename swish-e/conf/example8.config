# ----- Example 8 - Filtering PDF files -------
#
#  Please see the swish-e documentation for
#  information on configuration directives.
#  Documentation is included with the swish-e
#  distribution, and also can be found on-line
#  at http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/SWISH-E/
#
#
#  This example demonstrates how to use swish's
#  "filter" feature to index PDF documents.
#
#  Filters can be used to filter PDF or MS Word documents
#  to uncompress gzipped files, or to modify content
#  before indexing.
#
#  You will need the xpdf package installed to use
#  this filter.
#
#  See filter-bin/_pdf2html.pl for more information.
#
#  Please see the documentation on File Filters in
#  the SWISH-CONFIG.pod manual page.
#
#  Note:
#  If you are filtering many documents and/or using
#  a perl script to filter, see example9.config for
#  perhaps a faster way to filter.
#
