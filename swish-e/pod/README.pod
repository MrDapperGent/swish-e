=head1 What is Swish-e?

Swish-e is B<S>imple B<W>eb B<I>ndexing B<S>ystem for B<H>umans - B<E>nhanced.
Swish-e can quickly and easily index directories of files or remote web sites
and search the generated indexes.

Swish-e it extremely fast in both indexing and searching, highly configurable,
and can be seamlessly integrated with existing web sites to maintain a consistent design.
Swish-e can index web pages, but can just as easily index text files, mailing list archives,
or data sorted in a relational database.

Swish-e is an Open Source program supported by developers and a large group of users.
Please take time to join the Swish-e discussion list at http://Swish-e.org.

Swish-e version 2.2 represents a major rewrite of the code and the
addition of many new features.  Memory requirements for indexing have
been reduced, and indexing speed is much improved.  New features allow
more control over indexing, better document parsing, improved indexing
and searching logic, better filter code, and the ability to index from
any data source.

=head1 Where do I get Swish-e?

The current version of Swish-e can be found at:

http://Swish-e.org

Please make sure you use a current version of Swish-e.

Information about Windows binary distributions can also be found at
this site.

=head1 How Do I Install Swish-e?

Read the L<INSTALL|INSTALL> page.  Information on specific ports (VMS
and Win32) can be found in sub-directories of the C<src> directory.

The Windows binary can be found in the C<src/win32> directory.

In addition to the INSTALL page, make sure you read the
L<SWISH-FAQ|SWISH-FAQ> page if you have any questions, or to get an idea
of questions that you might someday ask.


=head1 The Swish-e Documentation

Documetation is provided in the Swish-e distribution package in two forms,
POD (Plain Old Documentation), and in html format.  The POD documentation
is in the F<pod> directory, and the HTML documentation is in the F<html>
directory, of course.

If your system includes the required support files and programs, the
distribution make files can also generate the documentation in these
formats:

    Postscript
    PDF (Adobe Acrobat)
    system man pages

You may also build a "split" version of the documentation where each
topic heading is a separate web page.  Building the split version also
creates a Swish-e index of the documentation that makes the documentation
searchable via the included Perl CGI program.

Buiding these other forms of documentation require aditional helper
applications -- most modern Linux distributions will include all that's
needed.  At least mine does...  You shouldn't have a problem if you have
kept your perl and perl libraries up to date.

Online documentation can be found at the Swish-e web site listed above.

See L<INSTALL|INSTALL> for information on creating the PDF and Postscript
versions of the documentation, and for information on installing the
SWISH-* documentation as Unix man(1) pages.


=head2 How do I read the Swish-e documentation?

The Swish-e documentation included with the distribution is in POD and
HTML formats.  The POD documentation can be found in the F<pod> directory,
and the HTML documentation can be found in the F<html> directory.

To view the HTML documentation point your browser to the
F<html/index.html> file.

The POD documentation is displayed by the "perldoc" command that is
included with every Perl installation.  For example, to view the Swish-e
installation documentation page called "INSTALL", type

   perldoc pod/INSTALL

or to make life easier,

   cd pod
   perldoc INSTALL
   perldoc SWISH-RUN

Complain to your system administrator if the C<perldoc> command is not
available on your machine.

=head2 Document Generation

The Swish-e documentation in HTML format was created with Pod::HtmlPsPdf,
a package of Perl modules written and/or modified by Stas Bekman to
automate the conversion of documents in pod format (see perldoc perlpod)
to HTML, Postscript, and PDF.  A slightly modified version of this package
is include with the Swish-e distribution and used for building the HTML.
As distributed, Swish-e contains only the pod and HTML documentation.
See L<INSTALL|INSTALL> for instructions on creating man(1), Postscript,
and PDF formats.

Thanks, Stas, for your help!

Contact the Swish-e list for questions.

=head1 Swish-e's History

SWISH was created by Kevin Hughes to fill the need of the growing number
of Web administrators on the Internet - many of the indexing systems were
not well documented, were hard to use and install, and were too complex
for their own good. The system was widely used for several years, long
enough to collect some bug fixes and requests for enhancements.

In Fall 1996, The Library of UC Berkeley received permission from
Kevin Hughes to implement bug fixes and enhancements to the original
binary. The result is Swish-enhanced or Swish-e, brought to you by the
Swish-e Development Team.

=head1 Document Info
