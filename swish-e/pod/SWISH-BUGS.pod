=item Does not index on Sparc64

SIGBUS reported on Sparc64 Debian 3.0 (compile farm at sourceforge).
gdb reports the following, although I'm not sure I believe gdb.

    Program received signal SIGBUS, Bus error.
    fs_already_indexed (sw=0xa7dc8, path=0xc0720 "btree.c") at fs.c:280

=item Phrase search failes with DoubleMetaphone

DoubleMetaphone searching can produce two search words for a single query
word.  The words are expanded to (word1 OR word2), but that fails in a
phrase query:   "some phrase (word1 or word2) here"

swish-e query parser is due for a rewrite, and this could be resolved then.

=item COALESCE_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE

Every so often someone see the error:

    err: Buffer too short in coalesce_word_locations.
    Increase COALESCE_BUFFER_MAX_SIZE in config.h and rebuild.

This happens when trying to index a document with a huge number of words.

This number should be increased or the buffer allocated dynamically.

=item Merging

merge.c does not check for matching stopwords or buzzwords in each index.

=item ResultSortOrder

ResultSort order is not used (and is not documented).  The problem is that
the data passed to Compare_Properties() does not have access to the
ResultSortOrder table.
