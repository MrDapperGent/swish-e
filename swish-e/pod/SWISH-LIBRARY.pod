SWISH-LIBRARY - Interface to the SWISH-E C library

=head1 What is the swish-e C library

It is a C library implementation based on swish-e-2.0 beta4, but
many of the functions have been rewritten in order to get a 
thread safe library.

=head1 Syntax of the functions of the library

At this moment (Aug 2000) there are 6 functions defined:

=over 4

=item struct SWISH *SwishOpen(char *IndexFiles);

This functions opens and reads header info of the index files
included in IndexFiles

    myhandle=SwishOpen("file1.idx");

Returns NULL on error

=item void SwishClose(struct SWISH *handle);

This function closes and frees the memory of a Swish handle

=item int SwishSearch(struct SWISH *handle,char *words,int structure,char *properties,char *sortspec);

This function executes a search for a handle

Input data:

    handle:  value returned by SwishOpen
    words: the search string
    structure: At this moment always one ( it will implement
        the -t option of swish-e)
    properties: Optional. Properties to display. Use NULL if
                no properties
    sortspec: Sort specs for the results. Use NULL if sort by rank

Returns the number of hits or a negative value on error

    results=SwishSearch(handle,"tit=test",1,"tit","date desc");
      
There is a new feature here that it is not included in swish-e-2.0: 
You can specify several sorting properties including a combination
of descending and ascending fields.

    field1 asc field2 desc 

=item struct result *SwishNext(struct SWISH *handle)

This function returns next result. It must be executed after 
SwishSearch.
Returns NULL on error or when no more results are available

=item int SwishSeek(struct SWISH *handle,int n)

This function puts the results pointer in the nth reult
Returns n if operation goes OK or a negative number on error.

=item int SwishError(struct SWISH *handle)

This function returns the last error

=item Stem(word)

XXX add
