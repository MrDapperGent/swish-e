/* 10/00 Jose Ruiz.
** The file and properties information can be compressed
** using the deflate algorithm. The code uses Jean-loup Gailly's zlib
** deflate algorithm but in a simpler way (no Huffman trees, simpler
** code and hashes, etc).
** Also, direct access is implemented to extract the information from
** the file as faster as possible. Zlib is stream oriented, so I could
** not use it.
** Thus, you must not expect great compression ratios.
** If enabled, the index proccess should be slower, but the performance
** of the search will not be affected
