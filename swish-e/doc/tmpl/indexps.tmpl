        SWISH-Enhanced is a fast, powerful, flexible, free, and easy to use system
        for indexing collections of Web pages or other text files. Key features
        include the ability to limit searches to certain HTML tags (META, TITLE,
        comments, etc.). SWISH-E is an enhanced version of
        <B>SWISH</B>, which was originally written by
        Kevin Hughes
        and modified and released with his permission.

    <p>
        <img src="images/swish2b.gif" alt="SwishE2 Logo"> is a new version with much of the code base
        rewritten for additional features, increased speed of indexing and searching, and improved
        security.  See the SWISH-E L<README|README> file for a list of features, downloading instructions,
        documentation overview, and support information.
