The SWISH-E FAQ

=head2 What is SWISH-E?

SWISH-E is B<S>imple B<W>eb B<I>ndexing B<S>ystem for B<H>umans - B<E>nhanced.
With it, you can quickly and easily index directories of files or remote web sites and search the generated
indexes.

=head2 Swish crashes and burns on a certain file. What can I do? 

You can use a FileRules operation to exclude the particular file name, or pathname, or its title. If there are serious problems in indexing
certain types of files, they may not have valid text in them (they may be binary files, for instance). You can use NoContents to exclude that
type of file.

=head2 Swish isn't indexing a certain word or phrase. 

By default, swish-e tries to make it best guesses as to what it thinks are reasonable words and filters out "garbage" words according to a set
of rules, for instance, if swish-e encounters a word that has no vowels, it doesn't index it. You can change these rules by editing the conf.h
file in the src directory of the swish-e distribution package. By editing the rules, you may be able to index quite a few more words, or less,
depending on your preference. 

=head2 How can I index all my compressed files? 

Swish doesn't currently have the capability to do on-the-fly filtering of files. In the meantime, first index the uncompressed data, compress it,
and using a ReplaceRules operation, change the suffix of indexed files to .Z or whatever is appropriate. That way users can retrieve the
compressed information.

=head2 Can I index 8-bit text? 

Yes, you can. Just remember that swish-e retains capitalization for all characters other than [a-z A-Z], so the word "Çelik" is not retrieved by
"çelik", "Celik", or "celik". You can index and use words containing any entity from ! (#033) to ÿ (#255). 

=head2 How can I index phrases? 

Phrases are indexed automatically.  To search for a phrase simply place double quotes around the phrase.

For example:

    swish-e -w 'free and "fast search engine"'

=head2 How can I implement keywords in my documents? 

In your HTML files you can put keywords in HTML META tags or in XML blocks.

META tags can have three formats in your source documents:

    <META NAME="DC.subject" CONTENT="digital libraries">

    <!-- META START NAME="meta1" -->
        some content
    <!-- META END -->

And in XML format

    <meta2>
        Some Content
    </meta2>


Then, to inform SWISH-E about the existence of the meta name in your documents,
edit the line in your configuration file:

    MetaNames DC.subject meta1 meta2

=head2 I want to generate a list of files to be indexed and pass it to swish-e. 

One thing you can do is make a simple script to generate a configuration file full of IndexDir directives.
For instance, make a separate file called files.conf and put something like this in it:

IndexDir /this_is_file_1/file.html
IndexDir /usr/local/www
IndexDir file2.html /some/directory/
...

Then call swish-e like this (assuming you're using a main swish-e.conf file): 

swish-e -c swish-e.conf files.conf

=head2 I run out of memory trying to index my files. 

It's true that indexing can take up a lot of memory!
One thing you can do is make many indices of smaller content instead of trying to do
everything at once. You can then merge all the smaller pieces together.

Another option is use the c<-e> switch.  This will require less memory, but indexing will take longer as
not all data will be stored in memory while indexing.  See L<SWISH-INDEX|SWISH-INDEX>.

=head2 I can't limit search to title/body/comment. I can't search with meta names, all the names are indexed as "plain" 

Check in the config.h file if #define INDEXTAGS is set to 1. If it is, change it to 0, recompile, and index again. When INDEXTAGS is 1,
ALL the tags are indexed as plain text, that is you index "title", "h1", and so on, AND they loose their indexing meaning. If INDEXTAGS is
set to 0, you will still index meta tags and comments, unless you have indicated otherwise in the user config file with the IndexComments
directive. 

=head2 Do I need to reindex my site each time I upgrade to a new Swish-e version? 

Yes. At times it might not strictly necessary, but since you don't really know if anything in the index has changed,
it is a good rule to reindex
anyway.
