INSTALL - SWISH-E installation instructions

=head1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

SWISH-E 2.0 is written in C, and, up to this time, it has been tested on
Solaris 2.6, AIX 4.3.2, RedHat Linux 6.2 and Win32 platforms (thanks to 
David Norris for his work).  To compile, a C compiler is needed. Pretty 
much any standard compiler should do.  Tested compilers include:

  gcc version 2.8.1 (Solaris 2.6)
  gcc version 2.95.2 (AIX)
  gcc version egcs-2.91.66 (Linux)
  
David Norris has built a Win32 version with Ms Visual C 6.0.  Please see
http://www.webaugur.com/wares/swish.

The HTTP file access method uses a Perl helper script that requires
the LWP,HTTP,HTML modules. (Note: depending on your perl installation, you might need to
install additional modules required by LWP; for requirements and
downloads check http://www.cpan.org or http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/search/cpan-search.html).
It was tested with Perl 5.005 although should probably work with any version 5 release.

A tip from Wil Vree about compiling with a Sun C compiler:
In the Makefile the following two opions need to be modified
CC = /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc
CFLAGS= -xO2

=head1 INSTALLATION

If you are reading this INSTALL document then you probably already have
downloaded and unpacked the distribution.

=head2 Downloading and unpacking and building

Make sure you are using the current
stable release from http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/SWISH-E/.  How you download is up to you:
lynx, lwp-download, wget are all common methods.

=item 1) Uncompress the distribution file

   gzip -dc swish-e.x.x.tar.gz | tar xof -

or on some versions of tar, simply

   tar zxof swish-e.x.x.tar.gz

Uncompressing should create the following directories:   

   swish-e-x.x/       (Location of the README* and INSTALL files)
   swish-e-x.x/src/   (source code)
   swish-e-x.x/conf/  (sample configuration file and stopword files)
   swish-e-x.x/test/  (test.html sample)
   swish-e-x.x/perl/  (perl interface to the SWISH-E library)
   swish-e-x.x/filter-bin/  (filter samples form Rainer Scherg)


=item 2) Make any needed changes in config.h

Compile-time configuration settings are adjusted in the file src/config.h.
You probably do not need to change this file.  See the src/config.h file
for instructions.

=item 3) Build SWISH-E

In the swish-e-x.x/ top level directory type the following commands

   ./configure
   make
   make test

This will create the swish-e executable src/swish-e and test that the
executable is working correctly.

You may optionally "build" the swish-search executable.  This is a
version of swish-e that cannot write to the index file.  This version
may provide improved security in a CGI environment.  The binaries swish-e and
swish-search are the same files -- the additional security is enabled when the
binary is named swish-search.

Again, this is an optional step:

   make swish-search

This simply copies swish-e to swish-search.   
 
=item 4) Install swish-e

Move the swish-e and/or swish-search executable to its final location
(normally /usr/local/bin).  You may need to su root.

   su root
   make install
   exit

The bin directory may be set when running ./configure. For example:

   ./configure --bindir=$HOME/bin

=head2 Installing the SWISH-E C Library

Swish 2.1 creates the C library libswish-e.a during the build.  This library is
required if you wish to embed SWISH-E into another application.  For example,
the library should be installed before using the high level Perl SWISH modules located
on CPAN. http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=SWISH

To install the library issue the following commands (you may need to su root)

   su root
   make install-lib
   exit

By default this will install the library in /usr/local/lib, but can be set when
running ./configure with the --libdir option.  For example:

   ./configure --bindir=$HOME/bin --libdir=$HOME/lib
