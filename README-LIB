This file contains some info about the swish-e library.

What is the swish-e C library
================================
It is a C library implementation based on swish-e-2.0 beta4, but
many of the functions have been rewritten in order to get a 
thread safe library.

How to build the library?
================================
In src directory, just type 

        make libswish-e

If you build swish-e executable (make swish-e) the library will also
be built

How to install the library?
================================
Just copy the libswish-e.a file to your favourite lib directory 
(normally /usr/local/lib)

Syntax of the functions of the library
=============================================
At this moment (Aug 2000) there are 6 functions defined:

struct SWISH *SwishOpen(char *IndexFiles);
      This functions opens and reads header info of the index files
      included in IndexFiles
      eg:  myhandle=SwishOpen("file1.idx");

      Returns NULL on error

void SwishClose(struct SWISH *handle);
      This function closes a and frees the memory of a Swish handle

int SwishSearch(struct SWISH *handle,char *words,int structure,
      char *properties,char *sortspec)
      This function executes a search for a handle
      Input data:
            handle:  value returned by SwishOpen
            words: the search string
            structure: At this moment always one ( it will implement
                the -t option of swish-e)
            properties: Optional. Properties to display. Use NULL if
                        no properties
            sortspec: Sort specs for the results. Use NULL if sort by rank
       
      Returns the number of hits or a negative value on error
      eg: results=SwishSearch(handle,"tit=test",1,"tit","date desc");
      
      (*) There is a new feature here that it is not included in swish-e-2.0: 
      You can specify several sorting properties including a combination
      of descending and ascending fields. eg: field1 asc field2 desc 

struct result *SwishNext(struct SWISH *handle)
      This function returns next result. It must be executed after 
      SwishSearch
      Returns NULL on error or when no more results are available

int SwishSeek(struct SWISH *handle,int n)
      This function puts the results pointer in the nth reult
      Returns n if operation goes OK or a negative number on error.

int SwishError(struct SWISH *handle)
      This function returns the last error

To do
=====

stemmer.c and soundex.c are not thread safe. 
More functions:
- Stemming and Soundex functions
- Functions to get data from the index header (eg: Wordcharacters)
- Index and Merge functions?
