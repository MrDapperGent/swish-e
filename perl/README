SWISH::API - Perl interface to the Swish-e C search library

$Id$

DESCRIPTION

SWISH::API is an Object Oriented interface to the swish-e C library.
This can be used to embed the swish-e search code into your perl program
avoiding the need to run the swish-e binary for searching.

The real difference is that search speed is improved since you may
attach to a swish-e index once and then run many queries on that open
"swish handle".  This speed comes at a cost of memory added to your program.

Note: This module replaces the SWISHE module available with versions prior
to 2.3 of Swish-e.  There is a SWISHE interface module available
on the Swish-e site if you have existing code that depends on 
previous versions of the SWISHE module.

    http://swish-e.org/Download/SWISHE-0.03.tar.gz

That version is simply an interface to the SWISH::API module.  You
must install the SWISH::API module to use SWISHE-0.03.tar.gz.

INSTALLATION

1) Download, build and install swish-e

    See http://swish-e.org for instructions.

    Swish is also available as a binary package from some
    operating system distributions (e.g. Debian).

2) Build the module in the normal way

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test


PROBLEMS

    If you have problems or need help please contact the swish-e
    discussion list.  The list is low traffic and is the place
    to get help with this module or swish-e in general.
