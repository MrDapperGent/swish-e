<P>A Boolean "and" between words is assumed; that is, documents will be
retrieved that have <B>all</B> the specified words. If you wish to find
all the documents that have <B>any</B> word, then use "or"  between your
search words. To truncate a word, use an asterisk (*) at the end. For
example, the search "comput*" would retrieve documents that have the words
"computer", "computing", "computation", etc. Search capability is being

<P>The Swish-e discussion began on July 9, 1997.

<A NAME="Policy"><H3>Posting Policy</H3></A>
<P>The following policy governs all postings to the Swish-e list.
Offenders will be warned once and removed from the list after a second
violation of the same policy:</P>

<OL>

<LI>All messages must relate to Swish-enhanced or issues related to the
development or implementation of it.
<LI> Advertisements are not appropriate. However, a simple statement that
offers a way to follow-up for more information on a service or product is
tolerated if it accompanies a substantive message discussing a subject
appropriate to the list.
<LI> Personal attacks such as name calling and personal insults will not be
tolerated. Comments that are intended only to
enrage the recipient rather than contribute to thoughtful discussion are
prohibited.

<LI> All postings must be free of copyright restrictions that limit
distribution. For example, posting a significant amount of a copyrighted
work verbatim requires the permission of the copyright holder. To verify
that such permission was obtained, all postings of this nature must
include a statement that this is the case.
</OL>

<H4>Full List of Commands</H4>

<P>Everything appearing in [ ] below is optional; everything
appearing in &lt; &gt; is mandatory; all arguments are case insensitive.
The vertical bar ("|") is used as a logical OR operator between the
arguments.  Requests may be abbreviated, but you must specify at least the
first three characters.</P>

<PRE>
help [topic]
------------
Without arguments, this file. Otherwise get specific information on the
selected topic. Topics may also refer to requests. To learn more about this
system issue a 'help listproc' request. To get a listing of all available
topics, generate an error message by sending a bogus request like 'help me'.

set &lt;list&gt; [&lt;option&gt; &lt;arg[s]&gt;]
------------------------------
Without the optional arguments, get a list of all current settings for
the specified list. Otherwise change the option to a new value for that
list, as follows:

        option can be: mail, password, address, conceal
        arg for mail can be: ack, noack, postpone, digest
        args for password have to be: current-password new-password
        args for address have to be: current-password new-address
        args for conceal can be: yes, no

        'set swish-e': get the current option settings for the list
        'set swish-e mail ack': your message is sent back to you
        'set swish-e mail noack': your message is not sent back to you
        'set swish-e mail postpone': no messages will be sent to you
                until you change mode again. NOTE: To resume messages,
                send the message 'set swish-e mail ack' or 'set swish-e
                mail noack' (explanations of these commands are directly
                above)
        'set swish-e mail digest': your message is not sent back to you.
                New messages are not sent to you as they arrive, but are
                accumulated into digests that are periodically sent to you.
        'set swish-e password &lt;current-password&gt; &lt;new-password&gt;':
                change your password for live access to the system (i.e.
                for subscriber access privileges when telneting to the system).
        'set swish-e address &lt;current-password&gt; &lt;new-address&gt;:
                change the address you are subscribed with; may not be available on all
                lists.
        'set swish-e conceal yes': remove yourself from 'recipients' and
                'statistics' listings.
        'set swish-e conceal no': opposite of previous mode.

subscribe swish-e youraddr@yourdomain

----------------------------
The only way to subscribe to Swish-e.

unsubscribe swish-e
signoff swish-e
------------------
Two ways of removing yourself from the discussion

recipients swish-e
review swish-e
-----------------
Get a listing of all non-concealed people subscribed

information swish-e
------------------
Get information about the list

statistics swish-e {[subscriber email address(es)] | [-all]}
-----------------------------------------------------------
Get a listing of non-concealed subscribers along with the number of messages
each one of them has sent to the specified list. If the optional email addresses
are given, then statistics will be collected for these users only. For
example:
                stat foo user1@domain user2@domain

will generate statistics about these two subscribers. "-all" lists statistics
for all users that have posted on the list (whether currently subscribed ot
not).

lists
-----
Get a list of all local mailing lists that are served by this server, as well
as of all known remote lists.

index [archive | path-to-archive] [/password] [-all]
----------------------------------------------------
Get a list of files in the selected archive, or the master archive if no
archive was specified. If an archive is private, you have to provide its
password as well.

get &lt;archive | path-to-archive&gt; &lt;file&gt; [/password] [parts]
----------------------------------------------------------
Get the requested file from the specified archive. Files are usually split in
parts locally, and in such a case you will receive the file in multiple email
messages -- an 'index' request tells you how many parts the file has been split
into, and their sizes; if you need to obtain certain parts, specify them as
optional arguments. If an archive is private, you have to provide its
password as well.

search &lt;archive | path-to-archive&gt;] [/password] [-all] &lt;pattern&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------
Search all files of the specified archive (and all of its subarchives if -all
is specified) for lines that match the pattern. The pattern can be an
egrep(1)-style regular expression with support for the following additional
operators: '~' (negation), '|' and '&'' (logical OR and AND), '&lt;' '&gt;'
(group regular expressions). The pattern may be enclosed in single or
double quotes. Note: . matches any character including new line.
