<dd>We are now using a special Perl script that interacts with Swish-e to perform
an interative search. The search word(s) are first limited to the titles
of Web documents. If none are found, it automatically continues on to find
the words in the bodies of the documents. Results are also sorted and
displayed by server directory.
