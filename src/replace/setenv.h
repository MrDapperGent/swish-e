/*********************************************************
 *  Replacement setenv/unsetenv for Windows 
 *********************************************************
 *  (excerpt from the Linux Programmerâ€™s Manual)
 *  DESCRIPTION
 *     The  setenv()  function adds the variable name to the environment with the value value, if name does not
 *     already exist.  If name does exist in the environment, then its value is changed to value  if  overwrite
 *     is non-zero; if overwrite is zero, then the value of name is not changed.
 *     The unsetenv() function deletes the variable name from the environment.
 *
 *  RETURN VALUE
 *     The setenv() function returns zero on success, or -1 if there was insufficient space in the environment.
 *     The unsetenv() function returns zero on success, or -1 on error, with errno set to indicate the cause of
 *     the error.
 *
 *  CONFORMING TO
 *     4.3BSD, POSIX.1-2001.
