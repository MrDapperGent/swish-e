This pages is intended to give users of SWISH-E an idea of the changes to
come, to foster discussion of the direction of SWISH-E, and a place where
developers can map out new ideas.

<P>
Most of this is just random notes that should be cleaned up!

<P>
I'm wondering if it might be smart to switch from the current ``Document
Types'' to Content-Types. Currently, swish know how to parse three types of
documents TXT, HTML, and XML. There's currently a new configuration
directives DefaultContents and IndexContents that map file extensions to
one of the three types. This doesn't really work when spidering since it's
the content-type that describes the document and not the file extension.

<P>
It's an issue that can wait, but I'm concerned about backward compatiblity
before people start using the IndexContents and DefaultContents config
directives and then we change to content-type in the future. There's
probably not that many people using those, but it might be work noting in
the documentation that it will change, if we agree.

<P>
The main reason to use content-type instead is for http processig where you
can't depend on the file extension to determine the document type, so with
http we have to use content-type to determine how to deal with the file.
The other reason to changes it is to break down the differences between
http and file system modes of indexing.

<P>
This would, of course, lead to other issues -- like dealing with IndexOnly
so that it might be a big enough change that it also needs to wait until a
later version (version 3.0?). But it should be something we think about,
and make note of in the documentation.

<P>
Again, I'd propose that swish uses a mime.types file to map from extension
to content-type. You could add or override mappings in the config file:

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>   AddType text/plain .doc .log</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>   DefaultType text/html  # like DefaultContents currently</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
The file source ``plug-in'' (whatever that ends up being) would return a
content-type, but if not returned then swish would map the type from the
file name using the mime.types file or any AddType directives.

<P>
Again, internally swish only knows about text/[TXT|HTML|XML], so there
should be a way to map other types, otherwise swish might ignore the file.
We could continue to use the three type names or switch completely to
content-types.

<P>
For example, if we continued to use [TXT|HTML|XML]

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    MapType TXT  text/directory text/logfile
    MapType HTML text/html</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Would tell swish that those types are handled by those internal handlers.

<P>
Then as I've mentioned before, you might specify filters as such

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>   FilterDocument application/msword /path/to/word-to-text</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
And word-to-text would convert to text and return one of the three
content-types that Swish knows how to parse, or a different content type if
were to chain filters.

<P>
First, I'd like to see the http part of swish moved out of the program, and
instead design a fast way for external programs to provide documents to
swish. Spidering is too complicated to be done internally, and is not
really what swish does at its core. No doubt that the swish package should
provide spidering, but in a different way.

<P>
So, I'd like to be able to specify to swish a program, and that program
returns the documents to swish to index, just as if swish was accessing the
documents via http. For example, the program would return headers followed
by the document content.

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    File-Name: docs/index.html
    Last-Modified: Fri, 22 Dec 2000 01:07:19 GMT
    Content-Length: 10483
    Content-Type: text/html
    &lt;blank line&gt;
    &lt;document contents&gt;</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
This could be any program -- one that spiders a number of servers at the
same time, or one that uncompresses local files before passing to swish.

<P>
Then the IndexDir command would list directories and/or files, and if a
file is an exectable program then swish runs and accepts documents from
that program.

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    # Index /usr/doc and spider our other server
    IndexDir /usr/doc /usr/local/bin/swish-spider</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
The program could be passed the path to the current configuration file
swish is using.

<P>
(BTW -- It might be nice to be able to say don't recurse directories:
/usr/doc recurses where /usr/doc/ doesn't recurse. Now that would be
confusing!)

<P>
Also <STRONG>NoContents</STRONG> could use content-types and not be limited to just the file system indexing
mode.

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    NoContents image/gif
    </pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>

Moseley: Dec 28, 2000

<P>
Find a way to create filtrers that can act as servers and be left in
memory. Leave the current filter system in place for smaller indexes. Using
sockets may be the most portable method. Could provide a perl module to
make it simple to create filters.

<P>

    <table>
      <tr>

	<td bgcolor="#eeeeee" width="1">
	  &nbsp;
        </td>

	<td>
	  <pre>    FilterDocument  /path/to/filter application/gzip application/zip</pre>
        </td>
	    
      </tr>
    </table>
    <P>
Any documents that are returned to swish of those content-types would be
passed to the filter program. The protocol would look a lot like http,
where swish sends headers and content, and returns headers and content. The
content could be passed onto other filters. If the content-type returned
matches one of the MapType assigned content types then the swish internal
parser would accept the document for indexing. Perhaps the FilterDocument
directive would be listed in order to allow chaining, but prevent loops.
