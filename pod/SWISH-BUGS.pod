Phrase search failes with DoubleMetaphone

DoubleMetaphone searching can produce two search words for a single query
word.  The words are expanded to (word1 OR word2), but that fails in a
phrase query:   "some phrase (word1 or word2) here"

swish-e query parser is due for a rewrite, and this could be resolved then.

ResultSortOrder

ResultSort order is not used (and is not documented).  The problem is that
the data passed to Compare_Properties() does not have access to the
ResultSortOrder table.
