The SWISH-E README File

SWISH-Enhanced is a fast, powerful, flexible, free, and easy to use system for
indexing collections of Web pages or other text files. Key features include the
ability to limit searches to certain HTML tags (META, TITLE, comments, etc.).

The current version of SWISH-E can be found at:
    http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/SWISH-E/
Please make sure you use a current version of swish.    
    
The SWISH-E documentation is in POD format.  POD documentation is displayed by
the `perldoc' command that is included with every Perl installation.
For example, to view the installation documentation for swish-e, type

   perldoc INSTALL

Check with your system adminstrator if this command is not available.
