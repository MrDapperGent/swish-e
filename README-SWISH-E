THE SWISH-E README 

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

SWISH-E 2.0 is written in C, and, up to this time, it has been tested on
Solaris 2.6, AIX 4.3.2, RedHat Linux 6.2 and Win32 platforms (thanks to 
David Norris for his work).  To compile, a C compiler is needed. Pretty 
much any standard compiler should do, the ones I used are: gcc version 2.8.1
(Solaris 2.6), gcc version 2.95.2 (AIX) and gcc version egcs-2.91.66 (Linux).
David Norris has built a Win32 version with Ms Visual C 6.0.

The HTTP file access method uses a Perl helper script that requires
the LWP,HTTP,HTML modules(Note: depending on your perl installation, you might need to
install additional modules required by LWP; for requirements and
downloads check http://www.cpan.org or http://theory.uwinnipeg.ca/search/cpan-search.html).
It was tested with Perl 5.005 although should probably work with any version 5 release.

A tip from Wil Vree about compiling with a Sun C compiler:
In the Makefile the following two opions need to be modified
CC = /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc
CFLAGS= -xO2

 
INSTALLATION

Downloading the C files and recompiling the executable
------------------------------------------------------
1) Download the swish-efiles.x.x.tar.gz into your directory, uncompress and
         untar it
         % gunzip swish-e-x.x.tar.gz
         % tar xvf swish-e-x.x.tar
 
         The command should create the following directories:
      swish-e-x.x/

      swish-e-x.x/src/   (source code)
      swish-e-x.x/conf/  (sample configuration file and stopword files)
      swish-e-x.x/test/  (test.html sample)
      swish-e-x.x/filter-bin/  (filter samples form Rainer Scherg)


2) Make any needed changes in the config.h to customize swish-e to
          your site. Probably you do not have to change this file.

3) Build swish-e. In swish-e-x.x/ derectory just type:
                 ./configure
                 make
          Now, you can find your swish-e executable in src directory

3) Compile the swish-search executable if desired
      (improved security when called from CGI, cannot write index files)
          
          %make clean
          %make swish-search
 
4) Run a quick test to make sure that the executable is working
          correctly.
 
                 make test
 

5) Move the swish-e and/or swish-search executable to its final location
       (normally /usr/local/bin) 
 
6) For instructions about how to index and search with swish-e check
         the Quick Start (http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/SWISH-E/Manual/quickstart.html)

7) The user.config file provided in the distribution is set for use with the FILESYSTEM.
   If you are using HTTP, comment out the directory of FILESYSTEM ONLY and set the ones for
   HTTP ONLY.

QUESTIONS AND TROUBLESHOOTING
